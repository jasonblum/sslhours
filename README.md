 # SSLHours

 SSLHours is a free and Open Source prototype to move the [MCPS SSL pdf form](https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/forms/pdf/560-51.pdf) online, allowing students' community service hours to be aggregated around "Leaderboards" by Student, School, Grade, Activity, Organization and Team.
